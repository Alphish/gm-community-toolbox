The GameMaker Community Toolbox is a project initiated and managed by [Alice Jankowska](https://github.com/Alphish).

Special mention goes to [Dickson Law](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583) (known on GameMaker Community forums as FrostyCat) for numerous function implementations and overall help with organisation.

Other people who helped implementing the Community Toolbox functions:
- [manta ray](https://github.com/biyectivo) (aka biyectivo) implemented [array_get_random/array_pop_random functions](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/26)
- [devKathy](https://github.com/devKathy) researched and made implementations of [Euclidean division functions](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/4)
- [gnysek](https://github.com/gnysek) suggested using `array_reduce` for `array_sum()` implementation (which later led me to finding and fixing the stack overflow bug in other array functions, but that's another story)

An honourable mention goes to [Silvio Mayolo](https://github.com/Mercerenies) (aka Mercerenies) for taking his time to review many, many pull requests.

Some of the functions included here were included by similar ones in [TurboGML](https://github.com/FoxyOfJungle/TurboGML) by [FoxyOfJungle](https://github.com/FoxyOfJungle).

Finally, I appreciate everyone's involvement in feature discussions and feature/name voting across GM communities as well! Special mention goes to [GameMaker Kitchen Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bzXzzC38VN) that helped refine some of the features.
