The GameMaker Community Toolbox is a project initiated and managed by [Alice Jankowska](https://github.com/Alphish). She also made the Community Toolbox logo.

A special mention goes to [Dickson Law](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583) (known on GameMaker Community forums as FrostyCat) for numerous function implementations and overall help with organisation. Another special mention goes to [Silvio Mayolo](https://github.com/Mercerenies) (aka Mercerenies), who took the time to review many, many pull requests and point out various issues or uncovered test cases.

People who helped implementing the Community Toolbox functions:
- [manta ray](https://github.com/biyectivo) (aka biyectivo) implemented [array_get_random/array_pop_random functions](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/26)
- [devKathy](https://github.com/devKathy) researched and made implementations of [Euclidean division functions](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/4)
- [TabularElf](https://github.com/tabularelf) implemented [constructor_call](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/99)
- [tinkerer-red](https://github.com/tinkerer-red) implemented [struct_filter](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/128)
- [gnysek](https://github.com/gnysek) suggested using `array_reduce` for `array_sum()` implementation, which led to other discoveries

Finally, I appreciate everyone's involvement in feature discussions and feature/name voting across GM communities as well! A special mention goes to [GameMaker Kitchen Discord](https://discord.com/invite/bzXzzC38VN) that helped refine some of the features and gave suggestions for the Community Toolbox logo.
