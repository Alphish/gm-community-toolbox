The GameMaker Community Toolbox is a project initiated and managed by [Alice Jankowska](https://github.com/Alphish).

Special mention goes to [Dickson Law](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583) (known on GameMaker Community forums as FrostyCat) for numerous function implementations and overall help with organisation.

Other people who helped implementing the Community Toolbox functions:
- [manta ray](https://github.com/biyectivo) (aka biyectivo) implemented [array_get_random/array_pop_random functions](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/26)
- [devKathy](https://github.com/devKathy) researched and made implementations of [Euclidean division functions](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/4)
- [gnysek](https://github.com/gnysek) suggested using `array_reduce` for `array_sum()` implementation (which later led me to finding and fixing the stack overflow bug in other array functions, but that's another story)

An honourable mention goes to [Silvio Mayolo](https://github.com/Mercerenies) (aka Mercerenies) for taking his time to review my pull requests.

Also, people whose suggested features made it to the Community Toolbox include:
- [Alice Jankowska](https://github.com/Alphish) ([is_nullish/is_defined functions](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/1) - but this one was arbitrarily chosen to have any base for Community Toolbox at all; [reading/writing text files as strings](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/10); [string_to_char_array function](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/47))
- [Dickson Law](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583) ([unlerp/relerp functions](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/8); [JSON saving/loading functions](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/9))
- [Silvio Mayolo](https://github.com/Mercerenies) ([approach/approach_angle functions](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/3); [Euclidean division functions](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/4))
- [Gizmo199](https://github.com/Gizmo199) ([lerp_angle function](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/15))
- [Gleb Tsereteli](https://github.com/glebtsereteli) ([shader_set_uniform_color function](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/22))
- [manta ray](https://github.com/biyectivo) ([array_get_random/array_pop_random](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/26) - this one was an offshoot of weighted random selection function)
- [TabularElf](https://github.com/tabularelf) ([array-based variations of min/max/sum/etc.](https://github.com/Alphish/gm-community-toolbox/issues/17))

As a final note, I appreciate everyone's involvement in feature discussions and feature/name voting as well!
